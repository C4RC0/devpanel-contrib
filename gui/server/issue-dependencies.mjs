 * Prerequisites between issues. A run on an issue whose prerequisite is still
 * open spends a start to learn that it must wait: an issue started before the
 * one whose rule it depends on can only have its triage ask the owner.
 * Recorded by an operator or the supervisor,
 * shown as `waitingOn` in the supervisor's overview, and the supervisor's
 * start_run refuses an issue while one is open. An operator may still start
 * it from the panel: the order is management, not a lock.
 *
 * A prerequisite is settled once it has a disposition or is archived (issue-family.mjs `settled`).
