/*
 * Triage pre-gate (rollout step 3 of docs/decisions.md).
 *
 * Before a Triage run starts, the decision provider is asked about the issue.
 * Its answer is recorded under the issue (`<issue>/decisions/`) and hard-linked
 * into the run it preceded, where the agreement report reads it.
 *
 * What it may change, and only when the answer is at or above the threshold:
 *
 *  - A confident `close-issue` or `needs-input` HOLDS the Triage start. The
 *    refusal carries proposals. Only an operator resolves a hold: by confirming
 *    a proposal, or by starting anyway with a stated reason. The top-level
 *    supervisor is not an operator and has no override.
 *  - Every confident answer becomes a proposal on the issue page. Nothing is
 *    applied until an operator confirms it, and a confirmation is written down
 *    with the decision record it rests on.
 *
 * Below the threshold, unavailable, or not configured: the start proceeds
 * exactly as it did before, and there is nothing to propose.
